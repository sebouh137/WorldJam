1)  Compiling:

To compile, type into the commandline:
mvn -o clean package appbundle:bundle

2)  Setup prior to running:

VPN:
It is necessary to use a VPN to connect to users outside of the LAN.  I recommend the VPN ZeroTier, and I have set up a network, 3efa5cb78a60df8f "World Jam Test" for this.  See zerotier.com for more details, and to download the VPN software.

Firewall:
It may be necessary to modify the settings for the firewall in order to allow incoming connections.  

Windows:
Control Panel -> Windows Defender Firewall -> Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall.  Select both public and private for Java.

MacOS:
System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall -> Firewall Options.  Add WorldJam to the list of applications.



3)  Running WorldJam:

To run client as an application (this brings up the client setup window):

MacOS:
double click on the icon for target/WorldJam-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT/WorldJam.app

Windows:
double click on the icon in target/WorldJam.exe


Any operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows), using the command-line:
java -jar target/WorldJam-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
