Step 2:  Adjust the offset between the input and playback:
Make a quick percussive sound (such as a finger-snap) into the audio input device on the first beat of the measure.  You should then hear it played back at the start of the next measure.

If the sound arrives early, then increase the offset

If it arrives late, then decrease the offset
